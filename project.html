        <h2>Find Your Best Energy Source</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Each of these technologies plays a crucial role in
           diversifying our energy sources, reducing greenhouse gas
            emissions, and moving toward a sustainable and clean energy future.
             They offer unique advantages and contribute to a more eco-friendly
              and efficient energy landscape.

          <h4>Solar Pannel</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Solar panels, also known as photovoltaic panels,
           convert sunlight into electricity. They consist of 
           solar cells made from semiconductor materials like silicon.
            When sunlight hits these cells, it excites electrons, generating a 
            flow of electricity. Solar panels are widely used to harness clean 
            energy for residential, commercial, and industrial applications,
             reducing dependence on non-renewable energy sources.

          <h4>Wind Turbine</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Wind turbines capture the kinetic energy of the wind and convert
           it into electricity. They consist of large rotor blades connected 
           to a generator. As the wind turns the blades, they spin the generator,
            producing electrical power. Wind turbines are a prominent feature of 
            wind farms and are vital for generating clean and renewable electricity 
            on a large scale.

          <h4>Pellet Heater</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Pellet stoves operate in a very different way to
           traditional wood burning stoves, in that they steadily 
           'feed' pellets from a storage container into a burn pot area.
            This means that pellet stoves can precisely control their heat
             output and also be highly-efficient

            <h4>Rain Water Harvesting</h4>
          </div>
          <p class="text">
            Rainwater harvesting is the simple process or technology
             used to conserve rainwater by collecting, storing, conveying
              and purifying of rainwater that runs off from rooftops, 
              parks, roads, open grounds, etc. for later use. Here, let
               us have a look at the diagram of rainwater harvesting system.

            <h4>Biogas</h4>
          </div>
          <p class="text">
            Biogas refers to a mixture of gases produced by the
             anaerobic decomposition of organic matter such as 
             agricultural waste, municipal waste, plant residue, 
             food waste etc. Biogas consists of methane, carbon dioxide,
              a small amount of hydrogen sulphide, and moisture.

            <h4>Geothermal</h4>
          </div>
          <p class="text">
            Geothermal energy is a type of renewable energy taken from
             the Earthâ€™s core. It comes from heat generated during the 
             original formation of the planet and the radioactive decay of
              materials. This thermal energy is stored in rocks and fluids
               in the centre of the earth.

            <h4>Hydroelectric</h4>
          </div>
          <p class="text">
            Hydroelectric generators harness the energy of flowing water,
             typically in rivers or dams, to generate electricity. Water is
              channeled through turbines, which are connected to generators.
               The force of the moving water causes the turbines to spin,
                producing electrical power. Hydroelectric power plants are
                 known for their reliability and capacity to provide a 
                 consistent source of renewable energy
